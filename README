How to use:

The vaes.py script will output usage info when run.

Run the vaes.py script in one of the following ways:

#############################################
To train a new model:

    $ vaes.py my_name train Church_VAE train_10K 2 250

"my_name" is a name for use as prefix for output files (pickled VAE). 
"train" tells the script to run in training mode. 
"Church_VAE" tells the script to use the Church VAE (can also be VVAE, Deep_VAE)
"train_10K" is the file (MSA) to train on
"2" is the number of latent dimensions
"250" is the size of the encoder/decoder layers for the church VAE (only necessary for Church_VAE, other vaes have different options here)


#############################################
To generate sequences:

    $ vaes.py my_name gen 100000

"my_name" is the name prefix for pickled VAE & output files.
"gen" tells the script to run in sequence generation mode. 
1000000 is the # of sequences to generate

#############################################
To compute energies

    $ vaes.py my_name energy MSAfile --ref_energy E.npy

"my_name" is the name prefix for pickled VAE & output files.
"energy" tells the script to run in energy computation mode. 
"MSAfile" is the MSA to compute energies for
--ref_energy (optional) is reference energies to include in comparison plot


#############################################
Other computations:

See the "run.sh" file. Can also compute TVD plot, latent space plot, C correlation plot, and more.
